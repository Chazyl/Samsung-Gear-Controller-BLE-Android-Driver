Technical Specification Document
App Name

Samsung Gear Controller BLE Android Driver
Project Description

The "Samsung Gear Controller BLE Android Driver" is an Android application designed to enable the Samsung Gear Controller—a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device originally intended for the Gear VR headset—to function as a system-wide input device on an Android device. The app must operate in the background, leveraging an accessibility mechanism to simulate inputs. It maps the controller's inputs (buttons, touchpad, gyroscope/accelerometer, and trigger) to Android functionalities such as volume controls, navigation keys, and mouse-like pointer interactions. The app assumes the controller is already paired with the Android device via Bluetooth settings.

Technical Implementation Guidance
Development Environment

    Target API: Minimum API Level 28 (Android 9.0) to support modern BLE features and Accessibility Service enhancements, aligning with devices like the Galaxy Watch4.
    Permissions:
        BLUETOOTH: For BLE connectivity.
        BLUETOOTH_ADMIN: For device discovery and pairing management.
        ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: Required for BLE scanning (post-API 23).
        SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW: For drawing the mouse pointer overlay.
        Accessibility Service permission (declared in manifest and enabled by user).

1. Pairing and Connecting to the Device
Implementation

    Library Choice: Android’s built-in Bluetooth LE APIs (BluetoothAdapter, BluetoothGatt).
    Why: These APIs are native, well-documented, and dependency-free, ensuring compatibility and stability without adding external libraries. Reference implementations (e.g., GitHub: GearVRControllerAppAndroid) use these APIs effectively.
    How:
        Device Listing:
            Use BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter().getBondedDevices() to retrieve paired devices.
            Filter devices by name (e.g., containing "Gear VR Controller") or a known identifier from reverse-engineering data (e.g., https://jsyang.ca/hacks/gear-vr-rev-eng/).
            Display the filtered list in a RecyclerView.
        Connection:
            Use BluetoothDevice.connectGatt() to establish a BluetoothGatt connection.
            Discover services and characteristics using BluetoothGatt.discoverServices().
            Enable notifications on relevant characteristics (e.g., UUID 19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214 for sensor data, per reverse-engineering notes).
        Reconnection:
            Store the selected device’s MAC address in SharedPreferences.
            Implement a BluetoothGattCallback to detect disconnections (onConnectionStateChange) and attempt reconnection when the device is detected via periodic scanning or system Bluetooth events.

Code Snippet
java
BluetoothAdapter adapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
Set<BluetoothDevice> pairedDevices = adapter.getBondedDevices();
List<BluetoothDevice> gearControllers = pairedDevices.stream()
    .filter(device -> device.getName().contains("Gear VR Controller"))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

BluetoothGatt gatt = selectedDevice.connectGatt(context, false, new BluetoothGattCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onConnectionStateChange(BluetoothGatt gatt, int status, int newState) {
        if (newState == BluetoothProfile.STATE_CONNECTED) {
            gatt.discoverServices();
        }
    }
});
2. Mapping Controller Inputs
Implementation

    Library Choices:
        BLE Parsing: Standard Android BLE APIs (no external library).
        Input Simulation: AccessibilityService for gestures and global actions, AudioManager for volume control, WindowManager for pointer overlay.
    Why:
        BLE APIs are sufficient for parsing raw data, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
        AccessibilityService enables background input simulation, critical for system-wide operation.
        AudioManager is the standard API for volume adjustments.
        WindowManager provides a lightweight way to display a custom pointer without complex overlay libraries.
    How:
        Buttons:
            Volume Up/Down: Listen for button press notifications on the corresponding BLE characteristic. Use AudioManager.adjustVolume(AudioManager.ADJUST_RAISE, AudioManager.FLAG_SHOW_UI) and ADJUST_LOWER.
            Home: Use AccessibilityService.performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME).
            Back: Use AccessibilityService.performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK).
        Gyroscope/Accelerometer:
            Parse sensor data from characteristic 19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214 (per reverse-engineering).
            Use gyroscope angular velocity (e.g., yaw for horizontal, pitch for vertical) to update pointer position.
            Integrate readings over time with a sensitivity factor (e.g., pixels per degree) to calculate movement delta.
            Update overlay position via WindowManager.LayoutParams.
        Trigger:
            Detect trigger press via BLE notification.
            Use AccessibilityService.dispatchGesture to simulate a tap at the current pointer coordinates.
        Touchpad Zones:
            Parse touchpad X/Y coordinates from BLE data.
            Divide into zones (e.g., Y < 25% = up, Y > 75% = down) and map to intended arrow actions.
            Limitation: Direct key event injection (e.g., KEYCODE_DPAD_UP) isn’t feasible with AccessibilityService. Instead, simulate directional gestures or explore UI navigation (e.g., ACTION_SCROLL_FORWARD)—mark as a future enhancement.
        Touchpad Click:
            Map to performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_RECENTS) as a proxy for the menu button, given KEYCODE_MENU is deprecated and not directly injectable.

Code Snippet
java
// Sensor data parsing (simplified)
public void onCharacteristicChanged(BluetoothGatt gatt, BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic) {
    byte[] data = characteristic.getValue();
    float gyroX = parseGyroX(data); // Custom parsing based on protocol
    float gyroY = parseGyroY(data);
    pointerX += gyroX * SENSITIVITY;
    pointerY += gyroY * SENSITIVITY;
    updatePointerPosition(pointerX, pointerY);
}

// Mouse click
GestureDescription gesture = new GestureDescription.Builder()
    .addStroke(new StrokeDescription(new Path(), 0, 100))
    .build();
accessibilityService.dispatchGesture(gesture, null, null);
3. Background Operation
Implementation

    Library Choice: Android Service (foreground) + AccessibilityService.
    Why: A foreground Service ensures BLE connectivity persists, while AccessibilityService handles input simulation in the background—both are native and robust.
    How:
        Create a ForegroundService to manage BLE connections and data processing.
        Use a persistent notification to indicate the app is running and provide a "Disconnect" action.
        Implement AccessibilityService to run alongside, processing inputs and simulating actions.
        Handle disconnection via the notification action, returning to the main activity for reselection.

Code Snippet
java
public class BLEService extends Service {
    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        Notification notification = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
            .setContentTitle("Gear Controller Active")
            .addAction(R.drawable.ic_disconnect, "Disconnect", disconnectIntent)
            .build();
        startForeground(1, notification);
        return START_STICKY;
    }
}
4. User Interface
Implementation

    Library Choice: Standard Android UI components (RecyclerView, TextView, ImageView).
    Why: Native components are lightweight and sufficient for a simple UI, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
    How:
        Main Activity:
            Use RecyclerView to list paired devices.
            TextView for MAC address.
            TextView array for button statuses (updated via BLE callbacks).
            ImageView with a cross drawable, updating segments based on touchpad zone.
            TextView for "Mouse Movement: True/False" based on sensor activity.
        Disconnect Button: Trigger service stop and return to device selection.

Code Snippet
java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private RecyclerView deviceList;
    private TextView macAddress, mouseStatus;
    private TextView[] buttonStatuses;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        deviceList = findViewById(R.id.device_list);
        macAddress = findViewById(R.id.mac_address);
        // Initialize UI elements
    }
}
Libraries and Rationale

    Bluetooth LE: BluetoothAdapter, BluetoothGatt
        Why: Native, no external dependencies, proven in reference projects (e.g., GearVRControllerAppAndroid).
    Accessibility: AccessibilityService
        Why: Enables background input simulation, critical for system-wide functionality.
    Audio: AudioManager
        Why: Standard API for volume control, no alternatives needed.
    Overlay: WindowManager
        Why: Lightweight, native solution for drawing a custom pointer.
    No Sensor Fusion Library: Manual parsing and integration of BLE sensor data.
        Why: Controller-specific data format requires custom handling; adding libraries like Apache Commons Math adds unnecessary overhead for simple integration.

Potential Challenges

    Sensor Processing: Achieving smooth, drift-free pointer movement may require calibration or advanced filtering (future enhancement).
    Arrow Key Limitation: Lack of direct key event injection restricts touchpad zone functionality—consider UI navigation or gestures as workarounds.

**Developer Implementation Notes & Considerations**
*(To be read alongside the main Technical Specification Document)*

This document outlines key challenges and focus areas identified during the planning phase for the "Samsung Gear Controller BLE Android Driver". While the technical specification provides a solid foundation using native APIs, careful attention to the following points during implementation will be crucial for success:

1.  **Accessibility Service:**
    *   **User Experience:** This is the biggest hurdle. Invest heavily in clear, user-friendly onboarding guides (potentially visual/animated) to explain *why* the service is needed and *exactly* how to enable it in system settings.
    *   **Reliability:** Be vigilant about background process killing by Android's battery optimization. Test thoroughly on various devices (especially Samsung, Google Pixel, and other popular brands) and Android versions (9+). Consider implementing robust error handling and potentially guiding users towards disabling battery optimization for the app if reliability issues persist, but treat this as a last resort due to user friction. Monitor the service's lifecycle carefully.
2.  **Pointer Control (Gyro/Accelerometer):**
    *   **Smoothing & Filtering:** The initial approach of direct sensitivity scaling might be too basic. Expect to spend significant time tuning this. Research and experiment with sensor fusion techniques (e.g., Complementary filters, potentially Kalman filters if complexity is warranted) to mitigate jitter and drift. Make sensitivity user-configurable.
    *   **Performance:** Profile the `WindowManager` overlay performance. Ensure pointer updates are efficient and don't excessively drain battery or cause UI lag.
3.  **BLE Connection Stability:**
    *   **Robust Reconnection:** Design the auto-reconnection logic to handle various scenarios gracefully (temporary signal loss, Bluetooth toggled off/on, controller sleep/wake, app restart). Implement exponential backoff or similar strategies for reconnection attempts to avoid draining battery.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for `BluetoothGattCallback` events (connection failures, service discovery issues, characteristic read/write failures). Provide informative feedback to the user if connection fails persistently.
4.  **Input Mapping Limitations:**
    *   **Touchpad Zones:** The inability to inject direct DPAD events is a known limitation. Clearly communicate this limitation in the UI/documentation. Focus on making the gesture simulation workaround (e.g., `ACTION_SCROLL_FORWARD`) as effective as possible for common use cases, but acknowledge it won't work everywhere.
    *   **Touchpad Click:** Be prepared for potential user confusion regarding the "Recent Apps" mapping. Consider if alternative mappings (e.g., `GLOBAL_ACTION_NOTIFICATIONS` or `GLOBAL_ACTION_QUICK_SETTINGS`) might be more useful, or make it configurable if feasible later.
5.  **Testing & Fragmentation:**
    *   **Device Diversity:** Prioritize testing on a wide range of physical devices and Android versions due to potential variations in BLE stacks and Accessibility Service implementations.
    *   **Controller Variations:** If possible, test with different Gear Controller hardware/firmware versions, as the reverse-engineered characteristics might vary.
6.  **Permissions:**
    *   **Clear Justification:** Provide concise, in-context explanations for *each* sensitive permission requested (`Accessibility`, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, `Location`/`Bluetooth Scan/Connect`). Link permissions directly to the features they enable.

**General Advice:**

*   **Iterative Development:** Build and test features incrementally, especially the core BLE connection, sensor processing, and accessibility input simulation.
*   **Logging:** Implement robust logging (especially around BLE events, sensor data, and accessibility actions) to aid debugging during development and potentially for user-submitted bug reports.
*   **User Feedback:** Integrate a simple mechanism for users to report issues easily from within the app.

By proactively addressing these areas, the team can mitigate risks and build a more robust and user-friendly application.
